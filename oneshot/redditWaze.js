  //Sets have the useful property that when elements are added to them in
  //their own forEach loop, they will iterate over those new elements as
  //well. Be careful about this with other data structures and languages!
  //It is somewhat uncommon for data structures to tolerate manipulation
  //during iteration.
  //Anyway, because of this, we can add new neighbors to the set as we
  //find them, and they will be scanned as well.
  //We also don't have to check if the set already contains the host,
  //because sets are sets of unique elements. The underlying structure of
  //a set typically makes it impossible to add duplicate elements at all.
  hosts.forEach(h => { ns.scan(h).forEach(n => hosts.add(n)); });

  //Sets are irritating to work with in list contexts, because concepts
  //like sorting are inapplicable to them (e.g. you might want to sort
  //these servers by difficulty). So we convert it back to a list.
  //If you look at the printed output, you might notice that the order
  //appears to be similar to the order in which the servers were scanned.
  //Do not rely on this behavior! It is purely a side effect of the
  //implementation of the set. A set has no concept of "order" and a
  //change in its implementation (or a new compiler optimization) could
  //produce a different order.
  //Of course, you might ask how it is the above "forEach" loop works if
  //the set has no order. The answer is... uh oh, something is wrong with
  //the b1^n&de... do you feel it? Run... save yourself...
  return Array.from(hosts); //<- make this write to a json file without crapping itself.
